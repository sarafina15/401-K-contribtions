# 401-K-contribtions
 ðŸ’°ðŸ’² The primary goal of this project is to analyze 401(k) contribution patterns to identify correlations with factors such as age, gender, years of service, and the effect of an enhanced match program introduced after July 1, 2016. Specifically, we aim to understand how these factors influence employee participation, contribution amounts, and overall funding. By doing so, we can help a financial institution managing 401(k) plans optimize their programs, identify gaps in participation, and design targeted strategies to improve employee contributions and enhance overall participation.
This analysis can help banks, employers, and financial institutions that manage 401(k) programs understand the factors influencing employee participation and contribution patterns. By identifying demographic groups that are underfunding their retirement savings, institutions can design targeted training, educational campaigns, or incentive programs to increase participation, enhance contributions, and ultimately maximize the growth of employeesâ€™ retirement funds.
